=========================
3rd Party Python Packages
=========================

When you want to run your PySpark application on a cluster such as YARN, Kubernetes, Mesos, etc., you need to make
sure that your code and all used libraries are available on the executors.

As an example let's say you may want to run the `Pandas UDF's examples <arrow_pandas.rst#series-to-scalar>`_.
As it uses pyarrow as an underlying implementation we need to make sure to have pyarrow installed on each executor
on the cluster. Otherwise you may get errors such as ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pyarrow'``.

Here is the script ``app.py`` from the previous example that will be executed on the cluster:

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd
    from pyspark.sql.functions import pandas_udf
    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession

    def main(spark):
        df = spark.createDataFrame(
            [(1, 1.0), (1, 2.0), (2, 3.0), (2, 5.0), (2, 10.0)],
            ("id", "v"))

        @pandas_udf("double")
        def mean_udf(v: pd.Series) -> float:
            return v.mean()

        print(df.groupby("id").agg(mean_udf(df['v'])).collect())


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main(SparkSession.builder.getOrCreate())


There are multiple ways to ship the dependencies to the cluster:

- Using PySpark Native Features
- Using Zipped Virtual Environment
- Using PEX


Using PySpark Native Features
-----------------------------

PySpark allows to upload Python files (``.py``), zipped Python packages (``.zip``), and Egg files (``.egg``)
to the executors by setting the configuration setting ``spark.submit.pyFiles`` or by directly
calling :meth:`pyspark.SparkContext.addPyFile`.

This is an easy way to ship additional custom Python code to the cluster. You can just add individual files or zip whole
packages and upload them. Using :meth:`pyspark.SparkContext.addPyFile` allows to upload code
even after having started your job.

Note that it doesn't allow to add packages built as `Wheels <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427/>`_ and therefore doesn't
allow to include dependencies with native code.


Using Zipped Virtual Environment
--------------------------------

The idea of zipped environments is to zip your whole `virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_, 
ship it to the cluster, unzip it remotely and target the Python interpreter from inside this zipped environment. Note that this
is currently supported *only for YARN*.

Zip Virtual Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can zip the virtual environment on your own or use tools for doing this:

* `conda-pack <https://conda.github.io/conda-pack/spark.html>`_ for conda environments
* `venv-pack <https://jcristharif.com/venv-pack/spark.html>`_ for virtual environments

Example with `conda-pack`:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -y -n conda_env -c conda-forge \
      pyspark==3.0.1 pyarrow==0.15.1 pandas==0.25.3 conda-pack==0.4.0
    conda activate conda_env
    conda pack -f -o conda_env.tar.gz

Upload to Spark Executors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unzipping will be done by Spark when using target ``--archives`` option in spark-submit
or setting ``spark.yarn.dist.archives`` configuration.

Example with ``spark-submit``:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=python
    export PYSPARK_PYTHON=./environment/bin/python
    spark-submit --master=yarn --deploy-mode client \
      --archives conda_env.tar.gz#environment app.py

Example using ``SparkSession.builder``:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
    from app import main

    os.environ['PYSPARK_PYTHON'] = "./environment/bin/python"
    builder = SparkSession.builder.master("yarn").config(
        "spark.yarn.dist.archives", "conda_env.tar.gz#environment")
    spark = builder.getOrCreate()
    main(spark)


Using PEX
---------

`PEX <https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex>`_ is a library for generating ``.pex`` (Python EXecutable) files.
A PEX file is a self-contained executable Python environment. It can be seen as the Python equivalent of Java uber-JARs (a.k.a. fat JARs).

You need to build the PEX file somewhere with all your requirements and then upload it to each Spark executor.

Using CLI to Build PEX file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    pex pyspark==3.0.1 pyarrow==0.15.1 pandas==0.25.3 -o myarchive.pex


Invoking the PEX file will by default invoke the Python interpreter. pyarrow, pandas and pyspark will be included in the PEX file.

.. code-block:: bash

    ./myarchive.pex
    Python 3.6.6 (default, Jan 26 2019, 16:53:05)
    (InteractiveConsole)
    >>> import pyarrow
    >>> import pandas
    >>> import pyspark
    >>>

This can also be done directly with the Python API. For more information on how to build PEX files,
please refer to `Building .pex files <https://pex.readthedocs.io/en/stable/buildingpex.html>`_

Upload to Spark Executors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The upload can be done by setting ``--files`` option in spark-submit or setting ``spark.files`` configuration (``spark.yarn.dist.files`` on YARN) 
and changing the ``PYSPARK_PYTHON`` environment variable to change the Python interpreter to the PEX executable on each executor.

..
   TODO: we should also document the way on other cluster modes.

Example with ``spark-submit`` on YARN:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PYSPARK_DRIVER_PYTHON=python
    export PYSPARK_PYTHON=./myarchive.pex
    spark-submit --master=yarn --deploy-mode client --files myarchive.pex app.py

Example using ``SparkSession.builder`` on YARN:

.. code-block:: python

    import os
    from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
    from app import main

    os.environ['PYSPARK_PYTHON']="./myarchive.pex"
    builder = SparkSession.builder
    builder.master("yarn") \
         .config("spark.submit.deployMode", "client") \
         .config("spark.yarn.dist.files", "myarchive.pex")
    spark = builder.getOrCreate()
    main(spark)

Notes
~~~~~

* The Python interpreter that has been used to generate the PEX file must be available on each executor. PEX doesn't include the Python interpreter.

* In YARN cluster mode you may also need to set ``PYSPARK_PYTHON`` environment variable on the AppMaster ``--conf spark.yarn.appMasterEnv.PYSPARK_PYTHON=./myarchive.pex``.

* An end-to-end Docker example for deploying a standalone PySpark with ``SparkSession.builder`` and PEX can be found `here <https://github.com/criteo/cluster-pack/blob/master/examples/spark-with-S3/README.md>`_ - it uses cluster-pack, a library on top of PEX that automatizes the the intermediate step of having to create & upload the PEX manually.
