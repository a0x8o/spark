-- WHERE operators: negative tests.
-----------------------------------

-- Aggregate functions are not allowed in the top-level WHERE predicate.
-- (Note: to implement this behavior, perform the aggregation first separately and then add a
-- pipe-operator WHERE clause referring to the result of aggregate expression(s) therein).

-- Pipe operators may only refer to attributes produced as output from the directly-preceding
-- pipe operator, not from earlier ones.
table t
|> select x, length(y) as z
|> where x + length(y) < 4;

-- If the WHERE clause wants to filter rows produced by an aggregation, it is not valid to try to
-- refer to the aggregate functions directly; it is necessary to use aliases instead.
