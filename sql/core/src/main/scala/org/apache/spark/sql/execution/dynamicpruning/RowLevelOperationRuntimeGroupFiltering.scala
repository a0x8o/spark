/**
 * A rule that assigns a subquery to filter groups in row-level operations at runtime.
 *
 * Data skipping during job planning for row-level operations is limited to expressions that can be
 * converted to data source filters. Since not all expressions can be pushed down that way and
 * rewriting groups is expensive, Spark allows data sources to filter group at runtime.
 * If the primary scan in a group-based row-level operation supports runtime filtering, this rule
 * will inject a subquery to find all rows that match the condition so that data sources know
 * exactly which groups must be rewritten.
 *
 * Note this rule only applies to group-based row-level operations.
