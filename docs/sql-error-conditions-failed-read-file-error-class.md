SQLSTATE: KD001

Encountered error while reading file `<path>`.

This error class has the following derived error classes:

## CANNOT_READ_FILE_FOOTER

Could not read footer. Please ensure that the file is in either ORC or Parquet format.
If not, please convert it to a valid format. If the file is in the valid format, please check if it is corrupt.
If it is, you can choose to either ignore it or fix the corruption.

## FILE_NOT_EXIST

File does not exist. It is possible the underlying files have been updated.
You can explicitly invalidate the cache in Spark by running 'REFRESH TABLE tableName' command in SQL or by recreating the Dataset/DataFrame involved.

## NO_HINT



## PARQUET_COLUMN_DATA_TYPE_MISMATCH

Data type mismatches when reading Parquet column `<column>`. Expected Spark type `<expectedType>`, actual Parquet type `<actualType>`.
