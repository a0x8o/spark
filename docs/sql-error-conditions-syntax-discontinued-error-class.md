[SQLSTATE: 42601](sql-error-conditions-sqlstates.html#class-42-syntax-error-or-access-rule-violation)

Support of the clause or keyword: `<clause>` has been discontinued in this context.

This error class has the following derived error classes:

## BANG_EQUALS_NOT

The '!' keyword is supported as a prefix operator in a logical operation only.
Use the 'NOT' keyword instead for clauses such as `NOT LIKE`, `NOT IN`, `NOT BETWEEN`, etc.
To re-enable the '!' keyword, set "spark.sql.legacy.bangEqualsNot" to "true".
